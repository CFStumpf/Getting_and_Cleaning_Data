Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
=========================

Repo for Coursera Course in Data Science Specialization.

This repo contains the file run_analysis.R as well as a code book.

This script is designed to do the following:

1) Check if the user has the reshape2 package installed.
2) Read the test and training data .txt files into single data tables.
3) Apply the appropriate activity labels from seperate .txt files.
4) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
6) Creates a new tidy data set which is appropriately labeled.
7) Outputs this to a new .txt file in the working directory.
